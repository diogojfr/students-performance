# End to End Machine Learning Project

This documentation is inspired by a series of videos from [Krish Naik YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZoTAELRMXVPS-dOaVbAux22vzqdgoGhG).

A machine learning algorithm is developed to predict student performance on the test according to the features available in the dataset.

The main goal of this data science project is to understand the entire data lifecycle, using pipelines and coding best practices to perform steps such as data ingestion, preprocessing, EDA, model training, evaluation, and deployment.
